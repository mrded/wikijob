We help them to manage a wide range of particular financial situations, both good and bad. When an airline goes into administration, what happens to the people who\u2019ve bought their flights? Who decides whether they\u2019ll be compensated? Who pays them? How about the staff \u2013 who will employ them to deal with the customers ringing up to ask what\u2019s happened?\n\u00a0\nBusinesses in financial trouble are among some of the clients we help. Our Business Recovery Services teams will go into a failing business and work with the client to turn things around, restructure the business, find someone else to take it on or help to run the business down so it can be closed. You might be surprised to know it can take years to get a business to the point where it can shut its doors, and often there are other solutions which mean it doesn\u2019t need to come to that.\n\u00a0\nOn the other hand, when our clients are doing really well, they may want to expand by buying another organisation or refocus by selling off part of the business. Our Transactions Services teams help clients through the process of valuing and buying or selling, in much the same way you\u2019d do with a house or car, to make sure the right price is being paid and everything runs smoothly.\nAs a Higher Apprentice in our Deals practice, you'll specialise in either Business Recovery Services or Transaction Services.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat you\u2019ll gain\nWe\u2019ll support you as you study for a Certificate in Finance, Accounting and Business. This is a nationally recognised professional qualification with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. At the same time, you\u2019ll enjoy plenty of practical, on-the-job training, and your hard work will be rewarded by a Diploma in Audit practice.
